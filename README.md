# The-Subway
Unity VR first person shooter game

Unity game made in Unity 5.3.4

It uses a Google Cardboard VR asset for the VR component of the game. It runs on an android device and uses a playstation bluetooth
controller to move the character and shoot the in-game enemy objects.

The scene itself was an attempt to recreate a simple subway station.

I used tutorials for help with some of the code (namely the ray cast script which I copied from an online tutorial and edited to fit my needs).
